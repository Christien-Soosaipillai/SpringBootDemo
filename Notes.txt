					-code that communicates with the database

StereoType Annotations: annotations in Spring are markers for any class that fulfills a role within an application.

@Component: Indicates that an annotated class is a “component”, meaning spring will auto-detect the classes for DI when scanning using anotations
@Controller: Indicates that an annotated class is a “Controller”, create a map of model objects and find a view
@Service: Indicates that an annotated class is a “Service”, specialization of the component which acts as the service-layer class
@Repository: Indicates that an annotated class is a “Repository” – It is an annotation that marks the specific class as a Data Access Object
